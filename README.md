# TryHackMe Room Database

A comprehensive tool for collecting and categorizing TryHackMe rooms. This project provides detailed information about each room, including difficulty, room type, subscription status, and more to facilitate a better user experience in cybersecurity training.

## Project Goals

This project aims to:
- Automatically scrape and gather information about TryHackMe rooms.
- Organize the data in a structured CSV format for easy access and analysis.
- Help users identify rooms based on their preferences and requirements.

## Collected Information

The following details are collected for each TryHackMe room:
 
- **Name**: The title of the room.
- **Link**: URL of the room.
- **Difficulty**: Difficulty level of the room (e.g., Easy, Medium, Hard).
- **Room Type**: Type of the room (CTF, Walkthrough, etc.).
- **Subscription Type**: Indicates if the room is free or requires a subscription.
- **Description**: Brief overview of the room.
- **Created At**: The date the room was created.
- **Number of Completion**: How many users have completed the room.
- **Number of Tasks**: Total tasks within the room.
- **Creators List**: List of creators who contributed to the room.
- **Duration**: Estimated duration to complete the room, in minutes.

## Features

- **Automated Scraping**: Gather data from multiple pages on TryHackMe.
- **Structured Output**: Save room details in a well-organized CSV file.
- **User-Friendly**: Easy to run and modify for individual needs.
