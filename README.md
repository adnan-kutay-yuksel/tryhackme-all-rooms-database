# TryHackMe All Rooms Database

A comprehensive tool designed to collect and categorize TryHackMe rooms. This project provides detailed information about each room, including difficulty, room type, subscription status, and more, to enhance the user experience in cybersecurity training.

## Project Goals

This project aims to achieve the following:

- **Automatically collect and organize information about TryHackMe rooms**: This project includes a web scraper that gathers details from TryHackMe rooms, such as room names, descriptions, difficulty levels, and categories.
- **Store the gathered data in a structured CSV file**: The collected information is saved in a CSV format, which makes it easier for users to sort, filter, and analyze the data using spreadsheet software or other analysis tools.
- **Assist users in finding the right rooms for their needs**: By providing a clear and well-organized list of available TryHackMe rooms, users can quickly identify rooms that match their learning preferences, such as specific topics or difficulty levels.


## Collected Information

The following details are collected for each TryHackMe room:
 
- **Link**: URL of the room.
- **Name**: The room's title.
- **Description**: A brief overview of the room.
- **Path**: The path which the room belongs to.
- **Difficulty**: Difficulty level (Info, Easy, Medium, Hard, Insane).
- **Room Type**: The type of room (CTF, Walkthrough).
- **Subscription Type**: Indicates whether the room is free or requires a subscription (Free, Premium).
- **Duration**: Estimated time to complete the room, in minutes.
- **Created Date**: The date the room was created.
- **Tool Types**: Types of tools required to complete the room.
- **Specific Tools**: Specific tools necessary to complete the room.
- **Target System**: The target name if a specific system is targeted.

## Features

- **Automated Scraping**: Gathers data from multiple pages on TryHackMe.
- **Structured Output**: Saves room details in a well-organized CSV file.
- **User-Friendly**: Easy to run and modify to suit individual needs.
